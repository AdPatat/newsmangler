2010-11-07: * Change asyncNNTP to extend asyncore.dispatcher channel methods
              properly.

2008-05-09: * Strip whitespace from the newsgroup list to obey RFC1036.

2005-11-11: * Change the Message-ID generation slightly to better match
              "expected" behaviour. (patch by Super-Fly)
            * Fix the =ybegin line so it has the correct line length.
              (patch by Super-Fly)

2005-11-06: * Bump the version to 0.02 to try and track down which version
              people are using.
            * Add the yEncode method we're using to the X-Newsposter header.
            * Require a newer ID string from yenc-freddie for it to be
              recognised.

2005-11-04: * Fix posted files count being incorrect if we end up skipping some
              things.

2005-10-25: * Modify some logic in yEncode_Python to follow the yEnc specs a
              little better. We now escape a leading period on a line, and
              never write more than linelen+1 bytes per line.

2005-10-21: * Add this file!
            * Add a log message detailing which yEncode version we're using.

2005-10-20: * Speed up article list generation a bit.
            * Add -fSUBJECT option for posting an arbitrary list of files
              instead of a directory/directories.
            * Use Psyco to speed up part encoding by 30-35% if it's available.
            * Use my modified yenc module to speed up part encoding by 65-70%
              if it's available.
            * Strip the directory name from the filename field of =ybegin when
              using files mode.
            * Reduce memory thrashing by not continually creating a new string
              for our data buffer. We now just use a pointer value and only
              read a new block of data in once we have exhausted the current
              one.
            * Add FakePoll class, emulates select.poll() on systems that do not
              have it (such as Windows).
            * Add -cCONFIG option to specify a different config file.

2005-10-19: * Print a status message once a second showing our progress.

2005-10-18: * Move some more logging to DEBUG level.
            * Don't set our posting start time until at least one thread is
              connected. This makes our posting speed more accurate.
            * Fix an invalid exception handler in asyncNNTP.
            * Only increment our byte count if we're posting a file, commands
              shouldn't count.

2005-10-17: * Disable our Date: header generator, let the server do it.
            * Modify the SO_SNDBUF of our sockets before we try to connect.

2005-10-14: * Add posting/skip_filenames option.
            * Clarify the comment for posting/default_group.
            * Fix the begin field of our =ybegin lines being off by one. This
              fixes decoding on NZB-O-Matic at least.
            * Write all groups out to the generated .nzb file if posting to
              more than one.
