Leecher
-------
* Actually write the leeching code.
* Add a command line option to watch a directory for new .NZB files and
  start leeching any that haven't been modified for 30s or so (don't want
  partially downloaded).


Poster
------
* Work out how to have the .NZB files generated before we start posting, so
  it can be posted along with the other files (for weird people).
* Add part retrying when something goes BORK with a connection.
